# 🥤 Lassi — Buy Solana NFTs Using USDC

Lassi lets you **buy NFTs on Magic Eden using USDC** instead of SOL.

## 🧠 Why Use USDC?

- **Stable Value:** USDC avoids SOL’s price volatility. Great for budgeting.
- **Fiat-Like Simplicity:** Feels like paying with a credit card.
- **New-User Friendly:** Many fiat onramps (MoonPay, Stripe, Transak) give users USDC, not SOL.

## 🔄 How It Works

1. You choose an NFT listed on Magic Eden.
2. Lassi checks how much SOL is needed.
3. It **swaps your USDC → SOL** via [Jupiter Ultra API](https://dev.jup.ag/docs/ultra-api/).
4. The NFT is purchased instantly—no manual steps required.
